# Steps to complete

1. Display a static date & time in the required format
2. Make the date dynamic
    - Give the date element an id
    - Create `main.js'
    - link `main.js` to `index.html
    - Create a map of integers to days of the week
    - Create a map of integers to months of the year
    - Use JavaScript to generate the current date
    - Use the current date object to get the formatted day of the week, month of the year, date, and year
    - Insert the current date into the DOM via the date id

3. Make the time in seconds dynamic
4. Make the time in minutes dynamic
5. Make the time in hours dynamic
