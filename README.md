# APPLICATION #1: DIGITAL CLOCK APP
## Description
This is a basic digital clock. It is the first app I was tasked to build as part of the Software Development Mastermind program.

The expectations for the project are listed in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).  
The steps I took and other errata are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.

I purposefully did this project as fast as I could, looking up as little as possible because I wanted my gut instincts to be the first thing I get feedback on.
